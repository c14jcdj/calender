calender
========

This is a dynamic calender that displays your appointments for a particular day.
The back end is not built.  I put comments in the code where I would make the ajax calls to the back end.
For this project I hard coded the json objects; so every day that you click on will render the same info.  The side bar scrolls to include a 24 hour break down of the day.
